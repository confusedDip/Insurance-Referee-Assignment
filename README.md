# Optimizing Referee Assignment in Vehicle Insurance Companies using Answer Set Programming


In the context of vehicle insurance companies, the Referee
Assignment Problem involves assigning a suitable referee to
a disputed claim. Such a problem arises when a claimant
disagrees with an insurerâ€™s decision regarding the settlement
of their claim, and the two parties cannot resolve the dispute
directly. In such cases, a referee is appointed to review the
case and make a final decision.

The referee assignment problem can be challenging
for vehicle insurance companies, as they need to consider
various factors while making the assignment. For instance,
the company needs to ensure that the referee is qualified to
review the specific type of claim, has no conflicts of interest,
and is available to review the case within the required
time frame. Moreover, the company needs to optimize
certain factors associated with the assignment, such as the
overall cost of the assignment, the balanced distribution of
workload and payment, and so on. Hence, this problem is
a perfect blend of a decision problem and an optimization
problem.

An efficient and effective solution to the referee assignment problem can be obtained using various approaches,
including manual assignment, rule-based assignment, and
optimization-based assignment. Answer Set Programming(ASP) is an optimization-based approach that can be
used to automate the referee assignment process. Clingo,
a high-performance implementation of ASP that provides
support for advanced solving techniques has been explored
and discussed in this work.
